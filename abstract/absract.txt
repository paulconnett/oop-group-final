This program implements a text-based, dungeon crawler game that utilizes object oriented design within the python language.
The program utilizes classes such as ‘Player’, ‘Enemy’, and ‘Item’ to manage game mechanics through a class-based structure. 
The game has a total of 10 levels, with players starting on level 1. On each level a randomized number of enemies of varying 
strength attack the player in an attempt to run out the player’s health. Players can perform actions like attacking and healing 
to defeat the enemies, which in turn grants the player currency depending on the difficulty of the enemies and their strength. 
Between levels, the player has the opportunity to utilize the store to purchase weapons, armor, and healing potions to face 
increasingly more difficult levels. This program is meant to demonstrate how object oriented programming can be used for a 
variety of different tasks within a program, and gives observers a fun, visual way to experience these multiple working parts.
